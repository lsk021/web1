A tag cloud (a typical Web 2.0 phenomenon in itself) presenting Web 2.0 themes
Web 2.0 (also known as Participative (or Participatory)[1] and Social Web)[2] refers to websites that emphasize user-generated content, ease of use, participatory culture and interoperability (i.e., compatible with other products, systems, and devices) for end users.
The term was coined by Darcy DiNucci in 1999[3] and later popularized by Tim O'Reilly and Dale Dougherty at the first O'Reilly Media Web 2.0 Conference in late 2004.[4][5][6] Although the term mimics the numbering of software versions, it does not denote a formal change in the nature of the World Wide Web, but merely describes a general change that occurred during this period as interactive websites proliferated and came to overshadow the older, more static websites of the original Web.[2]
<a href="https://www.w3.org">HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the standard markup language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications. This format description is for HTML 5, standardized in two coordinated efforts. One is by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), which maintains a specification for HTML as a modularized "living standard" at https://html.spec.whatwg.org/.

The second is at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). A series of snapshots of well-supported modules have been compiled and published as W3C Recommendations: 5.0 (2014); 5.1 (2016); 5.2 (2017). The latest W3C Recommendation is a result of a May 2019 agreement between W3C and the WHATWG regarding the development of a single version of the HTML specification. The specifics of the agreement can be found here and the latest recommendations for HTML can be found at the https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/. See Notes below for more on the relationship between W3C and WHATWG.</P>
